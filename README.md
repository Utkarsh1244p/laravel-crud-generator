## Supported Field Types for Factory Generation

When generating factories using the `--fields` option, the following field types are automatically mapped to Faker methods:

| Field Type     | Faker Method Used           |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
| string         | $this->faker->word          |
| text/longText  | $this->faker->text          |
| integer/bigInt | $this->faker->randomNumber  |
| float/decimal  | $this->faker->randomFloat(2)|
| boolean        | $this->faker->boolean       |
| date/dateTime  | $this->faker->dateTime      |
| json           | json_encode([...])          |

> ðŸ’¡ For `json`, a sample JSON-encoded array is returned, e.g., `json_encode(['key' => 'value'])`.
